He studied mathematics at the University of Stuttgart, with minor subject computer science.</p> Abstract <p>Carbyne Stack is based on the SPDZ MPC protocol, its online phase is deployed form the MP-SPDZ library. The necessary cryptographic material, i.e., authenticated Beaver Triples, have to be generated within an offline phase. However, readily available offline phase implementations are prohibitively expensive in terms of computational complexity and bandwidth consumption. Efficient offline phases with low communication can be based on the ring-LPN assumption. Such approaches require to generate sparse shared polynomials, which can be initialized by distributed point functions. This talk is an introduction to the necessary theory and will present the current state of our implementation and the expected cost savings.</p> <p> 3:30 pm Research Talk</p> <p>Secrecy: Secure collaborative analytics in untrusted clouds</p> <p> Recording</p> Dr. John Liagouris (Assistant Professor at Boston University) <p>John is an assistant professor of Computer Science at Boston University. His research interests lie in distributed systems and databases. Before joining BU, he was a visiting scholar at the RISELab, UC Berkeley, a senior researcher at the Systems Group, ETH Zurich, a visiting research fellow at the University of Hong Kong (HKU), and a research assistant at the \u201cAthena\u201d Research Center, Greece. John obtained his PhD from NTUA, Greece.</p> Abstract <p>In this talk I will present Secrecy, a novel MPC framework for secure relational analytics that we have been developing at Boston University. Secrecy can dramatically improve the performance of complex relational queries while retaining the full security guarantees of the cryptographic protocols. Compared to prior work, Secrecy takes a fundamentally different approach by opening the MPC black boxes to the database optimizer. Secrecy uses an analytical cost model that formulates query costs in terms of secure MPC operations and a query engine for vectorized MPC execution that employs a rich set of logical, physical, and protocol-aware optimizations. These optimizations enable Secrecy to outperform state-of-the-art frameworks and scale to much larger datasets than those reported in prior work. I will describe our ongoing work on integrating Secrecy with the Carbyne stack and conclude with a broader vision on a new generation of systems for privacy-preserving analytics in untrusted clouds.</p> <p> 4:00 pm Research Talk</p> <p>Generalized Tuples for MP-SPDZ</p> <p> Recording</p> Dr. Pascal Reisert (Postdoctoral Researcher at Institute of Information Security, University of Stuttgart) <p>Pascal studied Mathematics and Physics at the Ludwig-Maximilians University and Technical University Munich. He received his PhD in Algebraic Geometry in 2016. After postdoctoral positions in Mathematics and Physics he joined the Institute of Information Security Stuttgart under Prof. Ralf K\u00fcsters in 2019. His research and lectures concentrate on post-quantum secure cryptosystems and their application in Multi-Party Computation.</p> Abstract <p>Some of the most efficient protocols for Multi-Party Computation (MPC) follow a two-phase approach where correlated randomness, in particular Beaver triples, is generated in the offline phase and then used to speed up the online phase. Recently, more complex correlations have been introduced to optimize certain operations even further, e.g. matrix tuples for matrix multiplication, convolution tuples for tensor convolutions and polynomial tuples to evaluate multivariate polynomials. In this talk, we briefly discuss these different forms of generalized tuples, their advantages and trade-offs. Furthermore, we present benchmarks of our corresponding MP-SPDZ-extensions and compare them to state-of-the-art protocols like Overdrive. We show that the use of generalized tuples can significantly improve the performance of MP-SPDZ and of Carbyne Stack.</p> <p> 4:30 pm Research Talk</p> <p>Decentralized Cosmos-based MPC-as-a-Service powered by Carbyne Stack</p> <p> Recording</p> Jared Weinfurtner (Full-Stack Software Engineer for Privacy-Preserving Computing Technologies, Robert Bosch GmbH) <p>Jared is a Full-Stack Software Engineer with over 15 years of experience, focusing on rapid prototyping and the developer experience. Prior to joining Carbyne Stack, Jared was a researcher on Bosch's Economy of Things project in the area of decentralized energy trading incorporating self-sovereign identities and combining privacy-preserving computing technologies for day-ahead trading.</p> Abstract <p>To be able to run MPC-as-a-Service, we need a platform that performs matchmaking for those wanting to form a compute party, those wanting to secret share their data, and those wanting to perform computations. But who would operate such a platform? This talk will explore how we can utilize web3 technologies to operate this platform in a decentralized way utilizing the latest generation of delegated proof-of-stake blockchains, self-sovereign identities, verifiable credentials, and Carbyne Stack.</p> <p> 5:00 pm</p> <p>Coffee break</p> <p> 5:30 pm Hands-on Session</p> <p>Carbyne Stack Open Source Community Vision</p> Moderated by Sebastian Becker (Research Engineer, Bosch Research) <p>Sebastian is a Research Engineer at Bosch Research.

His research focuses on privacy, cryptographic protocols, applied cryptography, and computer security. He heads the Cryptography and Privacy Engineering Group (ENCRYPTO), whose mission is to demonstrate that privacy can be efficiently protected in real-world applications. For this, his group combines applied cryptography and algorithm engineering to develop cryptographic protocols and tools for protecting sensitive data and algorithms. For his research on cryptography and privacy engineering, he was awarded in 2019 with an ERC Starting Grant, the highest profile individual project funding in Europe.</p> Abstract <p>Secure two-party computation allows two parties to securely compute a function on their respective private inputs. It allows to preserve privacy in applications that involve a client and a single server. In this talk, I will give an overview on recent advances in the area of secure two-party computation. In particular, I will focus on the setting with semi-honest parties, which allows to construct the most efficient protocols. I will summarize two recent research results from the ENCRYPTO group: ABY2.0 (USENIX Security\u201921) allows highly efficient secure evaluation of Boolean circuits with multi-input AND gates and vector products, and FLUTE (IEEE S&amp;P\u201923) extends these results to multi-input lookup tables. Among many other applications, these protocols substantially improve efficiency of privacy-preserving machine learning.</p> <p> 2:30 pm</p> <p>Coffee break</p> <p> 2:45 pm Technical Talk</p> <p>Continuous Load Testing using Caliper </p> Julian Grewe (Working Student, Bosch Research) <p>Julian is pursuing his Master's degree in Business Informatics at the University of Stuttgart.

In the EU project Glaciation, MPC is key for SAP Security Research to ensure privacy-preserving data operations across the edge-to-cloud continuum. Here, Carbyne Stack is the cloud-native MPC solution to deploy, scale, and evaluate our research efforts and realize our use case. Specifically, we investigate how to augment MPC (to protect inputs) with differential privacy (to limit inference from outputs) in the context of collaborative machine learning across companies. Join us in this talk, to hear about the intersection of secure computation, differential privacy, and the technological foundation and enabler that is Carbyne Stack.</p> <p> 3:30 pm Technical Talk</p> <p>Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning with Nettle</p> Sebastian Becker (Research Engineer, Bosch Research) <p>Sebastian is a Research Engineer at Robert Bosch GmbH. His work focuses on making privacy-enhancing technologies easily adaptable to the needs of the wide range of application domains at Bosch. In this context, Sebastian also works as one of the maintainers of and main contributors to Carbyne Stack.</p> Abstract <p>With speed, cost, and privacy advantages, federated learning is emerging as an alternative to centralized ML approaches. However, without additional safeguards, federated learning won't live up to its promise, as it is vulnerable to privacy attacks and model theft. Our open-source Flower extension for privacy-preserving federated learning called Nettle fills this gap by deploying additional layers of defense. By integrating with our open-source Carbyne Stack Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC) platform, Nettle can effectively protect against privacy attacks via MPC-based Secure Aggregation. In addition, Nettle deploys Confidential Computing to protect valuable ML models from unauthorized model extraction on the client. In this talk, we describe the concepts behind Nettle, which are based on the idea of splitting the role of the Flower server into the three distinct roles of model owner, orchestrator, and aggregator. We show how we leveraged Flower's extensibility mechanisms to enable straightforward integration with the Carbyne Stack MPC services providing a scalable backend for Secure Aggregation. We describe how Confidential Computing enclaves and remote attestation are used in Nettle to ensure that the model owner retains full control over the ML model throughout the whole distributed learning process. Finally, we give a preview on what is to come for Nettle in the future.</p> <p> 3:45 pm</p> <p>Coffee break</p> <p> 4:00 pm Technical Talk</p> <p>Building Cross-Language Carbyne Stack Clients Using WebAssembly</p> <p> Recording</p> Jared Weinfurtner (Software Consultant/Engineer, Bosch Digital), Nicolai Huening (Working Student, SAP Research) <p>Jared is a Software Consultant &amp; Engineer at Bosch with over 15 years of experience.

Our goal was to plant a seed for an open ecosystem where state-of-the-art MPC technology can thrive. Building Carbyne Stack \u201cin the open\u201d has  been a deliberate choice and open source software plays a pivotal role as it fosters collaboration and transparency, allowing for continuous peer  review and rapid identification of vulnerabilities. As we approach a state where Carbyne Stack implements all the essential features for deployment in real-world use cases,  we believe it's time to rethink how we work together and decide on what a happy home for the Carbyne Stack community should look like. In this tag-team talk, Brian will  discuss the history and  importance of open source in the development of cryptographic software, then Sven and Chris will relate what Brian discusses to the history of Carbyne S tack and shed some light on the way forward for the initiative. </p> <p> 4:45 pm - 5:00 pm Closing Remarks</p>"},{"location":"community/events/csc24/#workshop-day-nov-28","title":"Workshop Day (Nov 28)","text":"<p> 9:00 am - 10:30 am Donating Carbyne Stack to an Open Source Foundation</p> Details <p>Carbyne Stack is coming of age.

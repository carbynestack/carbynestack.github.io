# Export Control

Carbyne Stack includes cryptographic software. The country in which you
currently reside may have restrictions on the import, possession, use, and/or
re-export to another country, of encryption software. **Before** using any
encryption software, please check your country's laws, regulations and policies
concerning the import, possession, or use, and re-export of encryption software,
to see if this is permitted. See the
[Wassenaar Arrangement](http://www.wassenaar.org) website for more information.

  title: Castor Service API
  description: |
    This API allows to interact with the Castor service. It provides methods to reserve and consume tuples, and to get
    telemetry data. The service endpoints are separated into two categories: inter-VCP and intra-VCP.

    - Inter VCP (`/inter-vcp`): \
      Endpoints for communication with other Virtual Cloud Providers in the same Virtual Cloud.
    - Intra VCP (`/intra-vcp`): \
      Endpoints that are to be consumed by the VCP internal services only. These endpoints are not intended to be
      exposed to the public or other VCPs.

    Please note that Castor does not provide an interface to the clients of a Virtual Cloud. Input tuples required for
    up- and downloading secrets are channeled through Amphora.

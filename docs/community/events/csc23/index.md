    Sven is a Senior Project Manager, Group Manager, Research Engineer, and
    open source software maintainer at Bosch Research. He has over 15 years of
    experience in the design, architecture, and implementation of distributed

???+ abstract "Abstract"

    Carbyne Stack is envisioned as a cloud-native operating system
    for MPC workloads, managing resources to make them run as efficiently as
    possible in real-world multi-cloud deployments. From a business
    perspective, it's the seed for an upcoming open ecosystem of technology
    building blocks that will accelerate the development and adoption of MPC
    technology across industries. This talk will cover various aspects of this
    vision and review how far the Carbyne Stack community has come towards
    making the vision a reality.

    We set out to make deploying Carbyne Stack as simple as running a single
    script to launch an entire infrastructure on every major cloud, including
    on your local machine.  _Infrastructure as Code_ (IaC) transforms the
    deployment experience by shifting from manual infrastructure management
    to code-driven automation. _Cloud Development Kit for Terraform_ (CDKTF)
    takes this evolution further, offering developers an intuitive and familiar
    programming language interface to define infrastructure.

    - Authorization and Identity Services in a Multi-Trust Environment
    - Data Preprocessing
    - Safe Debugging
    - Computation Auditing
    - Brokering Trust across Data Partners

    I'll be sharing my personal opinion on these challenges as well as some
    potential suggestions for future exploration.

    Sharemind MPC is a multi-party computation framework that was started in
    2007. It supports MPC schemes with different number of parties and
    adversary models and is focused on practicality by creating the SecreC
    programming language so non-cryptographers can write MPC programs.

???+ abstract "Abstract"

    State-of-the-art MPC protocols consist of two phases: An input-independent
    offline phase, which uses heavyweight cryptographic tools to generate
    so-called _cryptographic randomness_ in advance, which is consumed later
    during an online phase, where the actual function is computed very
    efficiently using only lightweight operations. This talk will cover how
    Carbyne Stack implements the offline phase in a scalable, extensible, and
    Kubernetes-native way by relying on the well-known Kubernetes Operator
    pattern.

    mission is to demonstrate that privacy can be efficiently protected in
    real-world applications. For this, his group combines applied cryptography
    and algorithm engineering to develop cryptographic protocols and tools for
    protecting sensitive data and algorithms. For his research on cryptography
    and privacy engineering, he was awarded in 2019 with an ERC Starting Grant,
    the highest profile individual project funding in Europe.

???+ abstract "Abstract"

    Secure two-party computation allows two parties to securely compute a
    function on their respective private inputs. It allows to preserve privacy
    in applications that involve a client and a single server. In this talk, I
    will give an overview on recent advances in the area of secure two-party
    computation. In particular, I will focus on the setting with semi-honest
    parties, which allows to construct the most efficient protocols. I will
    summarize two recent research results from the ENCRYPTO group: ABY2.0
    (USENIX Security’21) allows highly efficient secure evaluation of Boolean
    circuits with multi-input AND gates and vector products, and FLUTE
    (IEEE S&P’23) extends these results to multi-input lookup tables. Among
    many other applications, these protocols substantially improve efficiency
    of privacy-preserving machine learning.

    _Load-Testing-as-Code_ (LTaC) tool based on Gatling, developed to test
    Carbyne Stack's robustness and enable continuous performance validation.
    This talk will cover how Caliper is used to assess the effectiveness of a
    Carbyne Stack VPC deployment by allowing scenario testing that mirrors
    actual operational loads, as well as Caliper's integration into an
    automated testing process, to match the continuous evolution of the Carbyne

    his PhD from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) and his thesis
    received awards from ERCIM Security and Trust Management Working Group and

    privacy-enhancing technologies such as secure computation and data
    anonymization with applications for cross-company collaborations.

???+ abstract "Abstract"

    Secure multi-party computation (MPC) is the technological enabler to
    protect data in use and unlock enterprise collaborations on confidential
    data. In the EU project Glaciation, MPC is key for SAP Security Research
    to ensure privacy-preserving data operations across the edge-to-cloud
    continuum. Here, Carbyne Stack is the cloud-native MPC solution to deploy,
    scale, and evaluate our research efforts and realize our use case.
    Specifically, we investigate how to augment MPC (to protect inputs) with
    differential privacy (to limit inference from outputs) in the context of
    collaborative machine learning across companies. Join us in this talk, to
    hear about the intersection of secure computation, differential privacy,
    and the technological foundation and enabler that is Carbyne Stack.

with Nettle</span>

    Sebastian is a Research Engineer at Robert Bosch GmbH. His work focuses on
    making privacy-enhancing technologies easily adaptable to the needs of the
    wide range of application domains at Bosch. In this context, Sebastian also
    works as one of the maintainers of and main contributors to Carbyne Stack.

???+ abstract "Abstract"

    With speed, cost, and privacy advantages, federated learning is emerging as
    an alternative to centralized ML approaches. However, without additional
    safeguards, federated learning won't live up to its promise, as it is
    vulnerable to privacy attacks and model theft. Our open-source Flower
    extension for privacy-preserving federated learning called Nettle fills
    this gap by deploying additional layers of defense. By integrating with our
    open-source Carbyne Stack Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC) platform,
    Nettle can effectively protect against privacy attacks via MPC-based Secure
    Aggregation. In addition, Nettle deploys Confidential Computing to protect
    valuable ML models from unauthorized model extraction on the client.
    In this talk, we describe the concepts behind Nettle, which are based on
    the idea of splitting the role of the Flower server into the three distinct
    roles of model owner, orchestrator, and aggregator. We show how we
    leveraged Flower's extensibility mechanisms to enable straightforward
    integration with the Carbyne Stack MPC services providing a scalable
    backend for Secure Aggregation. We describe how Confidential Computing
    enclaves and remote attestation are used in Nettle to ensure that the model
    owner retains full control over the ML model throughout the whole
    distributed learning process. Finally, we give a preview on what is to come
    for Nettle in the future.

    trust in the web application itself — instead, trust is placed solely in
    the extension.

???+ abstract "Abstract"

    In recent years, milestones in the efficiency of MPC protocols have paved
    the way for the use of MPC in a wide range of applications. However,
    putting real-world MPC systems into operation is something that has not
    been the focus of research. It consists of several not-so-easy tasks,
    including finding the right set of MPC computing parties, deploying the
    system on heterogeneous infrastructure, and coordinating day-2 operations
    across administrative boundaries. In this workshop we want to collect
    and discuss things that make using MPC in the real world a challenging task

???+ abstract "Abstract"

    In this talk, I'll share some real world challenges faced in deploying
    multi-party-computation in machine learning (from time at Dropout Labs 
    working on tf-encrypted and Moose). Some of these challenges are likely
    familiar to the audience or users of CarbyneStack, including:

    - Authorization and Identity Services in a Multi-Trust Environment
    - Data Preprocessing
    - Safe Debugging
    - Computation Auditing
    - Brokering Trust across Data Partners

    I'll be sharing my personal opinion on these challenges as well as some
    potential suggestions for future exploration.

    Carbyne Stack promises to bring multi-party computation into the
    cloud-native world. Constellation promises to bring the security of on-prem
    data centers into the cloud. This session will show that both projects make
    good on their promises and how different privacy enhancing technologies can
    be stacked. We will learn about the guarantees Constellation provides, and
    how easy it is to deploy Carbyne Stack on a production cluster.

???+ abstract "Abstract"

    Sharemind MPC is a multi-party computation framework that was started in
    2007. It supports MPC schemes with different number of parties and
    adversary models and is focused on practicality by creating the SecreC
    programming language so non-cryptographers can write MPC programs.
    Recently, we decided to integrate Sharemind's machine-optimized protocols
    into Carbyne Stack. In the talk, we'll go over the current feature set of
    Sharemind MPC, why we decided to go with the integration route and the
    integration roadmap.

Computation</span>

???+ info "Prof. Dr-Ing. Thomas Schneider (Technical University of Darmstadt)"

    Thomas Schneider is full professor for Cryptography and Privacy Engineering
    in the Department of Computer Science at Technical University of Darmstadt,
    Germany. Before, he was independent research group leader at TU Darmstadt
    (2012-2018), did a PhD in IT Security at Ruhr-University Bochum
    (2008- 2011), and wrote his Master thesis during a research internship at
    Alcatel-Lucent Bell Labs, NJ, USA (2007). His research focuses on privacy,
    cryptographic protocols, applied cryptography, and computer security. He
    heads the Cryptography and Privacy Engineering Group (ENCRYPTO), whose
    mission is to demonstrate that privacy can be efficiently protected in
    real-world applications. For this, his group combines applied cryptography
    and algorithm engineering to develop cryptographic protocols and tools for
    protecting sensitive data and algorithms. For his research on cryptography
    and privacy engineering, he was awarded in 2019 with an ERC Starting Grant,
    the highest profile individual project funding in Europe.

???+ abstract "Abstract"

    Secure two-party computation allows two parties to securely compute a
    function on their respective private inputs. It allows to preserve privacy
    in applications that involve a client and a single server. In this talk, I
    will give an overview on recent advances in the area of secure two-party
    computation. In particular, I will focus on the setting with semi-honest
    parties, which allows to construct the most efficient protocols. I will
    summarize two recent research results from the ENCRYPTO group: ABY2.0
    (USENIX Securityâ€™21) allows highly efficient secure evaluation of Boolean
    circuits with multi-input AND gates and vector products, and FLUTE
    (IEEE S&Pâ€™23) extends these results to multi-input lookup tables. Among
    many other applications, these protocols substantially improve efficiency
    of privacy-preserving machine learning.

Learning</span>

???+ info "Dr. Jonas BÃ¶hler (Security Researcher, SAP Security Research)"

    Jonas BÃ¶hler is a senior researcher at SAP security research. He received
    his PhD from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) and his thesis
    received awards from ERCIM Security and Trust Management Working Group and
    the KIT faculty of computer science. His research interests are
    privacy-enhancing technologies such as secure computation and data
    anonymization with applications for cross-company collaborations.

???+ abstract "Abstract"

    Secure multi-party computation (MPC) is the technological enabler to
    protect data in use and unlock enterprise collaborations on confidential
    data. In the EU project Glaciation, MPC is key for SAP Security Research
    to ensure privacy-preserving data operations across the edge-to-cloud
    continuum. Here, Carbyne Stack is the cloud-native MPC solution to deploy,
    scale, and evaluate our research efforts and realize our use case.
    Specifically, we investigate how to augment MPC (to protect inputs) with
    differential privacy (to limit inference from outputs) in the context of
    collaborative machine learning across companies. Join us in this talk, to
    hear about the intersection of secure computation, differential privacy,
    and the technological foundation and enabler that is Carbyne Stack.

## Program

We are in the process of putting together an exciting CSC24 program for you.

Some of the questions that will be addressed throughout the event are:

- MPC in the context of GDPR: Does the use of MPC lead to anonymisation?

- Different ways to improve MPC efficiency: From combining PETs to using
  HW-accelerated NTTs

- MPC for AI: Can it be done?

- MPC use cases in different domains: Human Resources, AdTech and statistical
  offices

- Carbyne Stack is coming of age: What's next?

Take a look at the [CSC23 program][csc23-program] to get an idea of what to
expect. Stay tuned!

</p>

CarbyneStackCon '22 was a blast. We had an engaged audience of 20 MPC
enthusiasts on site and another 40 who dialed in from all over the world. In
addition to awesome talks on use cases and business ideas around MPC and Carbyne
Stack (we'll be making recordings available in the coming weeks), we used the
opportunity to work on a shared vision and roadmap for Carbyne Stack. It was a
pleasure to have you all as our guests. We look forward to seeing you all next
year at CarbyneStackCon '23!

<span class="gsoc-topic-section-title">Secure multi-party computation. When?
Which kind? For whom?</span>

???+ info "Dr. Dan Bogdanov (Chief Science Officer at Cybernetica, Board Member at the MPC Alliance)"

    Dan is the inventor of Sharemind, a secure multi-party computation system
    for collecting, sharing and processing private data. Sharemind has seen use
    by governments and companies who want to show their users that they cannot
    abuse the data they are entrusted with.

???+ abstract

    We’ve come a long way from securely comparing the wealth of two
    millionaires. We can use MPC to predict satellite collisions, evaluate
    neural networks, perform cryptographic operations. But I don’t even have an
    app on my phone to find if the salary range I’m offering overlaps with the
    expectations of a potential employee. Is the technology here too early? Are
    researchers working on the wrong problems? Who is MPC really for? This talk
    is both about barriers and opportunities.

Retrospective and Outlook</span>

???+ info "Dr. Sven Trieflinger (Senior Research Project Manager for Privacy-Preserving Computing Technologies at Bosch Research)"

    Sven is a Senior Project Manager, Research Engineer, and open source
    software maintainer at Bosch Research. He has over 15 years of experience
    in the design, architecture, and implementation of distributed systems and

    of privacy-preserving computing technologies and is spearheading open source
    computing on encrypted data technology with the Carbyne Stack cloud-native
    Secure Multiparty Computation platform.

???+ abstract

    On September 21, 2021, just a little over a year ago, Bosch Research open
    sourced an internally developed prototype of a cloud platform for Secure
    Multiparty Computation (MPC) that bridges the gap towards using MPC in an
    enterprise context by combining state-of-the-art MPC protocols and
    cloud-native technology. It is time to reflect on what we have achieved so
    far in terms of further developing the Carbyne Stack platform and building
    an open source community around it. Knowing the status quo will allow us to
    shed light on the necessary next steps towards a Carbyne Stack ‘Minimum
    Viable Platform’ for enterprise use from the Bosch research point of view.

???+ abstract

    Data-driven insights are critical for modern businesses to inform decision
    making and optimize processes. In cross-company collaborations necessary
    data is distributed among companies. Here, data sharing can face trust
    concerns or privacy issues. But can the data be analyzed without being
    revealed to anyone? In this talk, we discuss privacy-preserving data
    collaborations across companies where Carbyne Stack keeps data private and
    only share insights.

    The automotive industry can benefit greatly from the data created on the
    roads, while at the same time the privacy of the customers is a high aim in
    this. In this talk, we discuss options to support the use case of
    privacy-preserving computation in the presence of a scaling number of data
    providers, analysts, and potential algorithm providers and elaborate on a
    scalable multi-cloud architecture for the on-demand execution of MPC
    queries.

???+ info "Vincent Rieder (PhD Candidate at Bosch Research)"

    Vincent Rieder is a Phd student at Bosch, working on the topic of
    "Efficient and Secure Cloud Native Privacy Preserving Technologies", with a
    main focus on multi party computation. He studied mathematics at the
    University of Stuttgart, with minor subject computer science.

???+ abstract

    Carbyne Stack is based on the SPDZ MPC protocol, its online phase is
    deployed form the MP-SPDZ library. The necessary cryptographic material,
    i.e., authenticated Beaver Triples, have to be generated within an offline
    phase. However, readily available offline phase implementations are
    prohibitively expensive in terms of computational complexity and bandwidth
    consumption. Efficient offline phases with low communication can be based
    on the ring-LPN assumption. Such approaches require to generate sparse
    shared polynomials, which can be initialized by distributed point functions.
    This talk is an introduction to the necessary theory and will present the
    current state of our implementation and the expected cost savings.

???+ abstract

    In this talk I will present Secrecy, a novel MPC framework for secure
    relational analytics that we have been developing at Boston University.
    Secrecy can dramatically improve the performance of complex relational
    queries while retaining the full security guarantees of the cryptographic
    protocols. Compared to prior work, Secrecy takes a fundamentally different
    approach by opening the MPC black boxes to the database optimizer. Secrecy
    uses an analytical cost model that formulates query costs in terms of secure
    MPC operations and a query engine for vectorized MPC execution that employs
    a rich set of logical, physical, and protocol-aware optimizations. These
    optimizations enable Secrecy to outperform state-of-the-art frameworks and
    scale to much larger datasets than those reported in prior work. I will
    describe our ongoing work on integrating Secrecy with the Carbyne stack and
    conclude with a broader vision on a new generation of systems for
    privacy-preserving analytics in untrusted clouds.

    Pascal studied Mathematics and Physics at the Ludwig-Maximilians
    University and Technical University Munich. He received his PhD in Algebraic
    Geometry in 2016. After postdoctoral positions in Mathematics and Physics he

    Küsters in 2019. His research and lectures concentrate on post-quantum
    secure cryptosystems and their application in Multi-Party Computation.

???+ abstract

    Some of the most efficient protocols for Multi-Party Computation (MPC)
    follow a two-phase approach where correlated randomness, in particular
    Beaver triples, is generated in the offline phase and then used to speed up
    the online phase. Recently, more complex correlations have been introduced
    to optimize certain operations even further, e.g. matrix tuples for matrix
    multiplication, convolution tuples for tensor convolutions and polynomial
    tuples to evaluate multivariate polynomials. In this talk, we briefly
    discuss these different forms of generalized tuples, their advantages and
    trade-offs. Furthermore, we present benchmarks of our corresponding
    MP-SPDZ-extensions and compare them to state-of-the-art protocols like
    Overdrive. We show that the use of generalized tuples can significantly
    improve the performance of MP-SPDZ and of Carbyne Stack.

???+ abstract

    To be able to run MPC-as-a-Service, we need a platform that performs
    matchmaking for those wanting to form a compute party, those wanting to
    secret share their data, and those wanting to perform computations. But who
    would operate such a platform? This talk will explore how we can utilize
    web3 technologies to operate this platform in a decentralized way utilizing
    the latest generation of delegated proof-of-stake blockchains,
    self-sovereign identities, verifiable credentials, and Carbyne Stack.

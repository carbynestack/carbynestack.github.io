### [StackConf '22][stackconf22]

<span class="event-title">Scaling the Grail - Cloud-Native Computing on
Encrypted Data using Carbyne Stack (Contributed Talk)</span>

JULY 19 – 20, 2022 | BERLIN (GERMANY)

!!! abstract

    Computing on Encrypted Data (CoED) is considered a holy grail of data
    security. A major roadblock for the adoption of CoEDs is a lack of
    integration with cloud technologies to enable scalable, resilient, and easy
    to operate deployments. The Carbyne Stack open-source project has set out to
    close this gap. This talk will take the audience down the rabbit hole of
    CoED technologies and explain how Carbyne Stack blends cloud-native
    technologies to solve the challenges of scaling sensitive workloads.

### BoCSE '22

<span class="event-title">Computing on Encrypted Data – A hands-on tutorial
using the Open Source Carbyne Stack Secure Multiparty Computation Platform
(Tutorial)</span>

APRIL 4 – 7, 2022 | VIRTUAL (Bosch internal)

!!! abstract

    Computing on Encrypted Data (CoED) technology is a new mind-boggling way of
    protecting data in use. CoEDs can be used to implement IT systems where
    sensitive data is encrypted end-to-end: in transit, at rest, and even in
    use. CoEDs will play an increasingly important role in the future when it
    comes to protecting sensitive information in collaborative environments or
    meeting the requirements of increasingly stringent, diverse, and pervasive
    data protection regulations in our target markets.

    Participants of this tutorial will get to know the fundamentals of a CoED
    technology called Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC) that allows a set of
    mutually distrusting parties to securely compute a function of their private
    inputs, revealing only the output, even if some of the parties are corrupt.
    Participants will learn how to author simple MPC programs using a
    state-of-the-art MPC engine and how to use the Carbyne Stack open source
    cloud MPC platform to deploy MPC workloads in a scalable way. In addition,
    attendees will learn about the roadmap for the Carbyne Stack platform and
    how they can contribute to its development.

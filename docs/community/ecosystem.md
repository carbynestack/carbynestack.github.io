[Robert Bosch GmbH][bosch] started the Carbyne Stack open source project in
September 2021 by contributing an internally developed code base, and now
maintains the project and contributes regularly. Carbyne Stack is used by Bosch
to conduct proof-of-concepts in multiple domains with various partners.

University of Technology Sydney, Bosch, and Food Agility CRC have joined forces
to work on the publicly funded project [Collaborative privacy-preserving Digital
Agriculture][fa117]. One research track is focussing on Federated Learning with
MPC-based hardware-accelerated secure aggregation. The research results will
eventually be implemented by a UTS engineering team based on Carbyne Stack.

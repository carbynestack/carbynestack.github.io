The [Honda Research Institute Europe][hri] (HRI-EU) researches future
technologies advancing cooperative intelligent systems that will shape our
future in many ways, ranging from autonomous and accident-free driving to
personal robots and from smart design and manufacturing to the
privacy-preserving use of data. The privacy of users and customers is one of
HRI's essential goals, and they aim to live up to the trust of their customers.
HRI-EU contributes together with academic and innovative partners to Carbyne
Stack to implement this vision.

University of Technology Sydney, Bosch, and Food Agility CRC have joined forces
to work on the publicly funded project [Collaborative privacy-preserving Digital
Agriculture][fa117]. One research track is focussing on Federated Learning with
MPC-based hardware-accelerated secure aggregation. The research results will
eventually be implemented by a UTS engineering team based on Carbyne Stack.

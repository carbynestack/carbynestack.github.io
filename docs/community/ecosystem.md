University of Technology Sydney, Bosch, and Food Agility CRC have joined forces
to work on the publicly funded project [Collaborative privacy-preserving Digital
Agriculture][fa117]. One research track is focussing on Federated Learning with
MPC-based hardware-accelerated secure aggregation. The research results will
eventually be implemented by a UTS engineering team based on Carbyne Stack.

The [Honda Research Institute Europe][hri] (HRI-EU) researches future
technologies advancing cooperative intelligent systems that will shape our
future in many ways, ranging from autonomous and accident-free driving to
personal robots and from smart design and manufacturing to the
privacy-preserving use of data. The privacy of users and customers is one of
HRI's essential goals, and they aim to live up to the trust of their customers.
HRI-EU contributes together with academic and innovative partners to Carbyne
Stack to implement this vision.
